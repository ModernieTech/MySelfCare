## What is self-care?
Self-care (sometimes also called self-love) is a broad term that describes just about anything you do to be kind to yourself.  It can be anything from going for a run, journaling, sitting in nature, cooking a nutritious meal, having coffee with a friend, petting your cat, getting a massage, seeing a therapist, yoga, swimming, attending a support group, and much, much more!
